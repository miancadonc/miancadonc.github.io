###I graduated from Grinnell College in 2017 with majors in French and Biology. I'd had a really good four years, and I was leaving with a really good support network of friends, an appreciation for adequate sleep, and very little direction. I found myself with not enough passion in my chosen majors to pursue a career within their fields, so I picked up and moved in with a partner.

###I moseyed my way into being a relatively happy baker, having never considered that possibility before. Specifically, I loved how easy it was for me, being part of a team like that. Everyone works hard and takes care of each other on a bake team. There was also a fair amount of joy I could take in the physicality of being on my feet and active all day, and the creativity of the work and the ample opportunity for learning new skills helped keep me in high spirits. 

###I think that working in a bakery was an important stage in my life. I've learned about work ethic, creativity, and pride from such a job, and I'll have the kitchen skills to accompany me in front of my oven from now on. I did really enjoy the work, and doing it also helped me clarify why it wasn't for me. That life takes dedication and passion; I definitely have the passion for baking now, but working for around two years, I've come to understand that I have priorities beyond enjoying the work. 

###The most important priorities for my career that baking wasn't a good fit for are flexibility of hours and access to good health insurance. I simply haven't had enough time together with my social circle. I'm living my life and part of that is finding a rewarding career and part of it is building my community; I don't want to compromise on either, and the early morinng hours of baking makes community building a tenuous proposition. The other priority looms larger as I get closer to 26 and losing access to my parents' health insurance; I'm trans, and access to good insurance is very important to me, and what I've had access to as a baker has been insufficient.

**##So, all of this points away from baking, but why does it necessarily point towards coding?**

###Mostly, the answer to this question comes down to bringing something from my baking experience along with me in my career: the creativity, teamwork, and passion for learning new things whenever possible are very strong commonalities between the two paths. I'd always loved getting trained on a new bread, and I loved even more when I has to start baking it myself. As a maker of higher end, hand made bread, I really appreciated how finnicky bread can be, and just how many different interesting factors and skills go in to shaping all of the different recipes we used. I can't imagine trying to enter a career that I didn't see an enormous potential in to keep learning and learning; coding is a field where I see no reason to fear becoming stagnant. And the ability to noodle around for hours in interesting problems, then take it to a professional community and share what I've found and learn what others have done, all of this strikes me as important parts of entering the coding world that really go well with my personality and experience in my career and academics.

###Above all, I love to lose myself in learning a new skill. There's nothing I like better than feeling myself slowly becoming more capable, and I needed to find a career that fit that need while also fitting the career priorities I discovered I had while I was a baker.
